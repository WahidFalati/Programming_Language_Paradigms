To Run the program, first you must compile using your preferred compiler.
We use gcc, so in the terminal, type:
	gcc Assignment2.c
This will compile Assignment2.c into a file called a.out.

To run the file, in the terminal, type:
	./.a.out

If you are not able to run a.out, you may need to change the file mode of a.out.
To do this, in the terminal, type:
	sudo chmod +x a.out
This may prompt you for your password.
